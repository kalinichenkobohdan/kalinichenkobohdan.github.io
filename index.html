		<p>Hello.<br>
I am offering to let you create your personal <font color="red">Upwork.com</font> account and allow me to use it. Instead of using your personal information, I will pay you some profit every month.<br><br>

<font color="red">Why I’m not using my own:</font><br>
Because the Ukrainian hourly rate is low: $15/hr. But your country’s hourly rate is more than $40, so this is a win-win contract for both of us.<br><br>

<font color="red">Requirements:</font><br>
You need to have your national ID, driver's license, or passport.<br>
You have to install Anydesk on your unused PC. If you have only one PC, you can use a VMware virtual machine.<br>
You have to create and verify your payoneer account, so that we can use it for the withdrawal method on Upwork.<br><br>

<font color="red">What I offer:</font><br>
Flexible working hours and remote working.<br>
I will pay you $100 per month. After 3 months, I’ll send you 15% of monthly income.<br><br>

If everything works well for you, we can get started immediately.
